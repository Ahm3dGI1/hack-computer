**Course:** Build a Modern Computer from First Principles  

This repository contains my personal implementations for the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course, also known as *Build a Modern Computer from First Principles*. The course walks through building a complete computer system — from logic gates all the way to an operating system — entirely from the ground up.

---

## 🧩 Overview
Each project in this repo corresponds to a major step in the computer construction process:
1. **Boolean Logic:** Basic logic gates built from NAND.
2. **Boolean Arithmetic:** Adders, ALU components, and arithmetic chips.
3. **Sequential Logic:** Memory elements like registers, RAM, and counters.
4. **Machine Language:** Assembly programs written in the Hack language.
5. **Computer Architecture:** The complete CPU and memory system.
6. **Assembler:** Translating Hack assembly into binary machine code.
7. **Virtual Machine (VM):** Implementation of the VM translator.
8. **High-Level Language:** Compiler elements for the Jack programming language.
9. **Operating System:** Core system utilities written in Jack.


## 🧠 About This Repo
These projects were completed as part of my journey to deepen my understanding of computer architecture and low-level systems design.  
Each folder includes my personal implementation, notes, and explanations.
